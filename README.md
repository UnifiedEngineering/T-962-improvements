T-962 reflow oven improvements
==============================
This project is a fork of the original Unified Engineering firmware for the T-962 reflow oven. This version primarily changes the UI, as I wanted something a little more aesthetic. I added a pre-built .hex file to make it simple to update an oven without needing to install an IDE to build it!
